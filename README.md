Welcome to your first Flutter project, "World Time"! This simple app allows users to choose a country from a list, fetch its current time, and dynamically change the background based on whether it's day or night.

## Features

- **Country Selection:** Users can choose a country from a list of available options.
- **Real-time Data:** The app fetches real-time data to display the current time of the selected country.
- **Dynamic Background:** The background changes dynamically based on the time of the day - displaying a day picture if it's daytime and a night picture if it's nighttime.
